Object Oriented Programming (OOP) :

Access Modifiers:
    Public : Accessible in all classes in your application
    Protected : Accessible within package
    Private : Only within the class.
    Default : same class and package.


Class : it is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects and created.
Object : it is an instance of the class.

This keyword is reference to the current object.

Pillars of OOP:

1.Abstraction:
    Process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object, ignoring the irrelevant details.
    Abstraction is achieved by interfaces and abstract classes.
    100% abstraction using interfaces.
    The abstract method contains only method declaration but not method implementation.

    Ex:
        // abstract class
        abstract class Demo {
            // abstract method declaration.
            abstract void add();
            abstract void mul();
            abstract void div();
        }

2. Encapsulation:
