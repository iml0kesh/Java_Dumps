Question 1:
Scenerio (Indirect)
find the largest among the given array using function and without using looping and pre-defined functions.
constraints
    -100 > n < 100
    -100 > a[i] < 100

sample input

FIX THE Fourmula

KAILY has been tricked by her brother to answer a question with a number. She is perlexed.

"Fo+23the3*like2+" it took time fo her to understand now she wants to automate it with a program so that any time her brother comes with such tricky string she could answer with lesser efforts.

here is what we have to do, seperate the math operations and digits like in the above string ypu can see the operators {+,*,+} and digits {2,3,3,2} rest all are ignored now arrange the digits and opratoers in the order of apperance to get the cprrect result.

2+3*3+2

to be solved as
(2+3) = 5
then (5*3) = 13,
then (15+2) = 17.

so for the given string "Fo+23the3*like2+" the final answer is : 17.

public int fixTheFormula(String input1){

}

Assumptions :
1) Numbers present in the string are always considered as 0 - 9
2) only operators used in the string are (+,-,*,/)
3) Always will have length + 1 to operators in the above example.
